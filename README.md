🚀 Goal of the Analysis

We aim to uncover global salary patterns and trends across the Data Science and AI/ML industry by answering questions like:

    How do salaries differ by job title and experience level?
    Which countries or regions offer the highest average salaries?
    How does remote work affect compensation?
    Are there differences across company sizes?
    How have salaries evolved from 2020 to 2025?

✨ First Steps

We will begin with the first step in the data analysis workflow: Data Cleaning, which includes:

    Inspecting the dataset to understand its structure and identify potential issues
    Handling missing values (e.g., removing, imputing, or flagging them depending on context)
    Detecting and correcting inconsistencies such as incorrect data types, formatting errors, or invalid entries
    Removing duplicates to ensure data integrity
    Standardizing categorical values for consistency across the dataset
    Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew further analysis
    Ensuring overall data quality before proceeding to exploratory data analysis

🧠 Let’s explore the data and uncover insights that drive the future of AI and Data Science!
